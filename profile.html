										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/me2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Born and raised in the midwest of the United States, I have always had a fierce passion for nature and being outdoors.
										When I am not tinkering with technology, I find my peace on hiking trails, kayaking local rivers, and camping as close
										to 'nowhere' as I can find. I dream of hiking my country's long trails and visiting our iconic national parks. Many of 
										my favorite childhood memories include the backpacking trips I took with my dad and our friends in the wild places of 
										Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, and Missouri.
									</p>
									<p>I'm also a family man. My wife, Pam, and I were high school sweethearts and have been together ever since. In an age 
										where that can seem strange, I'm grateful that she is my one-and-only love. We have two great kids, who both keep us on 
										our toes and are a constant source of pride and amazement. My daughter is a talented muscian, as well as one of the best 
										speech and debaters in the nation. My son builds computers, solves Rubicks puzzles for fun, and is a blue belt in jiu-jitsu. 
										The diversity of activities in my house is often surprising!
									</p>
									<p>Finally, and most significantly, I strive to be a follower of Jesus Christ. That means reading and understanding 
										scripture, having a servant's heart, seeking to know and do whatever is right, beautiful, and good in accordance with 
										God's own definitions, and to always be prepared to give an answer for the hope that I have of eternal life. In today's 
										world, people sometimes have difficulty accepting views and beliefs contrary to their own. It is one of our most sacred 
										gifts to have the right and ability to choose, as individuals, what to believe or not believe. However, it is one of our 
										most sacred responsibilities to treat others with the grace and courtesy that attests to the inherent value and dignity 
										of every person.
